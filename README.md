<h2>Welcome to my portfolio GitHub!</h2>

<p>
This is where I host the files for my website <a href="https://amacpherson.dev" target="_blank">amacpherson.dev</a>. The site includes a short description of relevant experiences, various endorsements given by a wide variety of people, and contact information to reach out to me. I built the site myself, with help from <a href="https://html5.up.com" target="_blank">HTML5 UP</a> under the <a href="https://html5up.net/license" target="_blank">Creative Commons License</a>.

Website design has been a passion of mine from an early age and transformed into a broad love of Computer Science that I hope you will see reflected in the portfolio. More specifically, over the past few years, I have become passionate about data analysis and am will shortly be working full time in the field. Please peruse my experiences and reach out if you'd like to know more, or for anything else. Enjoy!

Update: I've included a data visualization project I completed abroad at the University of Roehampton (London, England). It features 10 data vizzes from a common dataset – The UK National School Survey Project – made in Tableau and with descriptions underneath. It is not yet fully integrated but can be found at <a href="https://andrewm.tech/vizzes" target="_blank">andrewm.tech/vizzes</a>.
