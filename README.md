<h2>Welcome to my portfolio GitHub!</h2>

<p>
This is where I host the files for my website <a href="https://andrewm.tech>andrewm.tech</a>. The site includes a short description of relevant experiences, various endorsements given by a wide variety of people, and contact information to reach out to me.

I built the site myself, with help from <a href="html5.up.com">HTML5 UP</a> under the <a href="https://html5up.net/license">Creative Commons License</a>.

Website design has been a passion of mine from an early age and transformed into a broad love of Computer Science that I hope you will see reflected in the portfolio. More specifically, I have since become passionate about data analysis and have what I believe to be a considerable amount of experience with it. Please peruse my experiences and reach out if you'd like to know more, or for anything else. Enjoy!

Update: I've included a data visualization project I completed abroad at the University of Roehampton (London, England). It features 10 data vizzes from a common dataset – The UK National School Survey Project – made in Tableau and with descriptions underneath. I have not yet integrated it with the main page but it can be found at <a href="https://andrewm.tech/vizzes>andrewm.tech/vizzes</a>.
