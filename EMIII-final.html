                        <h1>Introduction to the Michigan</h1>
                        <p>Named for its first performance by Mike Legg at the University of Michigan in 1966, the Michigan shot resembles a move from lacross more than hockey. After balancing the puck flat on the shooter's stick plate, the player lifts their stick up and curves it towards the goal, dumping it into the goal off the goalie's shoulder. <br><br> The Michigan needs to be seen to be fully understood though. Here's Mike Legg trying the move out for the first time:</p>

                        <p><br>Only in recent years has the move caught on across the NHL. After Andrei Svechnikov's initial Michigan goal in 2019, only 3 other players have been able to replicate the move. Schenikov has since done it again but has been beat out by Anaheim's Trevor Zegras, who's successfully pulled it off 3 times (though only counting in a game once), plus 2 more times when he's used the technique to perform a pass.</p>

						<h2>Experimental Setup</h2>
						<div class="row">
                            <p>To analyze the physics of what's going on, I deemed it necessary to capture my own data by performing the shot myself. As an amateur hockey player, this took some practice but I eventually was able to do it well enough that the motion was largely replicable. I then set up a camera and recorded myself performing the shot. I used a chair as a mock goal post around which to wrap the puck.</p>

                    <h2>Modeling Frictional Force</h2>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p>The underlying phenomena that makes the Michigan possible is the existence of static friction and centripetal acceleration. Just as, with enough speed, one can swing a bucket of water over their head without getting wet, a hockey player can keep the puck on their stick even at an angle where a stationary puck would be expected to fall.<br><br>
                            
                        The first force keeping the puck up is the aforementioned static friction. In a frictionless environment (such as the ice hockey is often played on), the puck would be expected to slide off the stick at any sort of angle from the horizontal. Yet this is not the case, even when stationary. Evidently, some sort of force must be keeping the puck up with a magnitude equal to the gravitational force pulling it down. It can be shown experimentally that the material of the tilted surface directly affects the angle of slippage via the <b>coeffieicnt of friction</b>.
                        </p>
                        
                        <img src="images/emIII/angles%20of%20slippage%202d.jpeg" class="inline-graph">
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="row">
                        <p> However, this model actually simplifies things a bit too much for a hockey stick. The curve of the blade means that the puck experiences gravitational force in two directions. If the above image is modeled along the xy-plane, one must also account for the z-axis in which the diagram is tilted out of or into the page. <br><br>
                        When lying flat on the stick, the natural curve of the stick's blade leads to the surface itself being titled by 7° along the z-axis. With the natural materials of the stick, the blade can then be tilted 33° in the xy-plane before slippage begins to occur. However, if hockey tape is added to the stick, the surface on which the puck sits now has a higher coefficient of friction and does not slip until 37° of tilting. This is particularly useful for the Michigan, which relies on the puck being pinned in place despite downward gravitational force. <br><br>Note that many hockey players tape their sticks in different ways. Here I have used a standard heel-to-toe tape style to maximize friction. I have also modeled the surface the puck rests on as a flat surface since it largely is and the curve of the blade only comes into play when the puck is moving along the blade, which it is not for this shot. (For a good example of when it does, see the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQfbBPBk-D0" target="_blank">toe drag</a>).
                        </p>

                    <h2>Modeling Centripetal (Normal) Force</h2>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p>The other force holding the puck in place, particularly when it moves, is the centripetal force that results from centripetal acceleration. As the puck accelerates through space along a curve, it experiences a force that pins it to the stick blade. <br><br> 
                        Centripetal force of course comes from the curved acceleration of an object. Accelerating a water bucket in a straight line above your heard won't do anything to keep you from getting wet. <br><br>
                        Though an object may appear to accelerate along a curve, at any given instant in time, the acceleration is linear and straightforward; it is merely having its direction changed continuously (this is why it is an acceleration, even if speed is kept constant). To see this in action, swing a cord with a mass of some sort tied to the end in a circle. If you let go, the mass will not continue to curve but will instead fly off in a straight line at the moment of release.
                        <br><br>
                        This linear acceleration can be modeled as having two components that are perpindicular to one another, one of which points inwards, towards the center of rotation. This is necessary since the total acceleration and tangential acceleration are not aligned – there must therefore be another vector component connecting them.
                        </p>

                    <div class="row">
                        <p>However, this model of centripetal force presumes a perfectly curvilinear path, which we have already seen is not the case. Instead, it is best to think of this force as coming from the <b>normal force</b>, the result of the equal and opposite reaction prescribed by Newton's Third Law. <br><br>
                        Every object always feels a gravitational acceleration but when placed on a flat surface, objects are capable of being at rest. The reason is that the equal and opposite normal force is pushing up on the object just as much as gravity is pushing down; thus the net force is zero.

                        <p>Thus far I have only abstractly explained the forces holding the puck throughout the motion of the Michigan shot. Let us now calculate their values with real data. As show above, the puck has a mass of 53.7 g, which we will be using in all these calculations.

                        <p><br>Perhaps surprisingly, the frictional force is also dependent on the normal force. It may seem counterintuitive that two forces acting in very different ways are both dependent on the normal, but when considering that the puck is only in contact with one surface, it makes more sense.

Though this is a 3-dimensional problem, we can model it as being two-dimensional along the axis of greatest incline, which is not changing near the slippage threshold.

                        <p>With the benefit of experimental data, let us now compare it with the model. Our positional data was fairly smooth save for some minor bumps and our velocity largely follows suit until we get to the apex of the shot.</p>

                        <p> Both x, y, and total velocity all experience a brief period of extreme variation followed by minor bounce but a general return to form. Even without comparing to the video, we can tell that this disturbance comes at the peak of the shot by the drop off in y-velocity shortly after, signifying the puck being released from the stick. Looking at the video assures us that this variation is a data error and not an observed phenomenon. At no point in the shot does the the puck's velocity come close to approaching 40 m/s, even if the chart suggests otherwise. With this in mind, we can remove the erroneous data points and we are left with a smoother chart.

                    <div class="row">
                        <p>To perform the removal, let us first identify roughly where the distrubance is happening. Careful examination of the data tells us it occurs from roughly t = 0.91 s to t = 0.95 s. To be sure, excluding these points, calculate the standard deviation of the rest of the data. If we remove values where the change in velocity is greater than 2 standard deviations, we can likely conclude this is an erroneous data point. This leaves us with a much smoother graph, albeit one with a bit of a gap.

                        <p>Smoothing the velocity graph is important because acceleration is the derivative of velocity and distubances perpetuate and get magnified. However, we also only care about the acceleration up until the puck falls off the stick and, since we can't take the derivative of non-continuous points, we can instead cut the time axis off at t = 0.92. <br><br>If out theories are correct, we should expedt that </p>

                        <p>Everything is within our bounds! Here I have compard total acceleration (due to the forces along both axes) to the total force to ensure boundary consistency. When we consider that the actual acceleration will be much smaller, both because the forces will rarely, if ever, be additive, and because multiplying by the mass to get the force will decrease the absolute value, the boundaries are shown to be satisfied! Indeed both in x and in y, no points exceed the maximum force predicted to occur and thus we can conclude that we have accurately described the physics of the Michigan! </p>
