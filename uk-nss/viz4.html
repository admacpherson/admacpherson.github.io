                       This chart shows the distribution of student answers for each question, broken down by subject. The pages are interactive and allow you to select which question you would like to see the answer distribution for. The results are displayed as a stacked bar chart with a color scale representing the five answers students were asked to select from, which are: “Definitely disagree,” “Mostly disagree,” “Neither agree not disagree,” “Mostly agree,” and “Definitely agree,” represented by the numbers 1 through 5 respectively. This provides more nuanced feedback than a simple agree/disagree statement as students can weight their agreement or disagreement or remain neutral altogether. The overall feedback is positive, especially on questions like #12: “I have been able to contact staff when I needed to,” but is more negative at times as well, like on Question #25: “It is clear how students’ feedback on the course has been acted on.” It is also possible to tell a story by comparing subjects on a single (or indeed multiple) question(s). Veterinary Science students, for example, seem to find their courses more intellectually stimulating than Media, Journalism, and Communication students (Question #3). Together, the charts provide an interactive interface to tell numerous easily digestible stories about student satisfaction with multiple levels of nuance.
